## Complete your Profile

After registration, you’ll go through a short onboarding process:

1. Confirm your name and country.
2. Accept CrunchDAO’s participation rules.
3. Optionally, add details to your profile (bio, socials, etc.).

Linking your socials makes it easier to log in and helps other Crunchers discover your work.

### Link your Kaggle Account

To prove ownership of your Kaggle profile:

1. First, connect GitHub or Twitter on both CrunchDAO and Kaggle.
2. Go to your Crunch account page, click Link Kaggle, and enter your Kaggle username.

This step ensures secure verification. You can later disconnect the link(s) from Kaggle if you wish.

## Secure your Account

For wallet use and enhanced security, Crunch requires multi-factor authentication (MFA). You can choose:

* **Passkey** – allows direct passwordless login.
* **Authenticator App** (e.g. Google Authenticator).

You may disable MFA later if needed, but enabling it is strongly recommended.
