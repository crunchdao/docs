## Privacy

No content is ever stored. Just the fact that you did something, where, and when.

For Discord messages, the channel name and message ID are stored, but never the content of the message itself. If you decide to remove your message, you can be sure that the content will be lost forever.

### Ghost Activities

Activities are never removed, so the activity graph may show a larger number of activities if the original resource has been deleted.
