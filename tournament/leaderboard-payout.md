# Leaderboard & Payout

## Global Leaderboard

You can access the [Global Leaderboard here](https://tournament.crunchdao.com/global-leaderboard/).

![Example of Global Leaderboard](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Only the Global LB** based on live data **will be used for payout**.
{% endhint %}

## Payouts

Payouts are calculated daily.

You will be rewarded with our utility $CRUNCH token.

Payout happens after month completion.

## Payouts calculation

Payouts are computed based on global ranks and distributed as an exponential function to the global live leaderboard positions.

This proposal has been done by @correlator and has been voted by the community.

After downloading the live leaderboard as CSV, you can run this google Colab to re-compute the payouts and/or propose a new payout function:
