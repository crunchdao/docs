# üèé Leaderboard - Payout

### Round Leaderboard

You can access your weekly Round[ Leaderboard here](https://tournament.crunchdao.com/leaderboard)

![Example of Round LB](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

Your Round LB score is calculated based on the Mean [Spearman Ratio](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html) correlation between your predictions and the targets.

```
// from scipy.stats import spearmanr
def spearman(y_true, y_pred): 
    return spearmanr(y_pred, y_true).correlation * 100
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Round LB scoring is only here to give you feedback on hold out data and will **NOT** be used for payout. Be careful to not overfit on test data...
