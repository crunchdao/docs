# Leaderboard & Payout

## Global Leaderboard

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Only the Global LB** based on live data **will be used for payout**.
{% endhint %}

## Payouts

Payouts are calculated daily.

You will be rewarded with our utility $CRUNCH token.

Payout happens after month completion.

## Payouts calculation

Payouts are computed based on global scores and distributed as an exponential function to the global live leaderboard scores.
