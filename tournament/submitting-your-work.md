## Submission Limit

The Tournament is limited to 10 submissions per round.

This value can be incremented by referring some people. Each level will get you one additional submission.

| Referred Count | Bonus Submission |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1              | 1                |
| 3              | 1                |
| 5              | 1                |
| 8              | 1                |
| 10             | 1                |

Before the end of the round you will have to select your best submission. If not we will automatically consider the submission with the best score on the test set.

### Scoring
