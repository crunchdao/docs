# Managing

## Modifications

Modifications can only be done while in a [Submission Phase](../../other/glossary.md#submission-phase). That includes:

* [creating a new team](managing.md#creating-your-team)
* [editing your team](managing.md#editing-your-team)
* [creating a new referendum](referendums.md)
* [voting a referendum](referendums.md#voting)
* [accepting an invitation](managing.md#team-invitations)

## Creating your team&#x20;

If you see a TEAMS tab in the navigation bar, that means that you can submit as a team.

* The team name must be unique. The format must be a slug: all lowercase, with letters, numbers, and hyphens.
* The team description is just an optional text that will be displayed on your team overview.
* Looking for teammates allows users to find teammates. Teams can also advertise that they are looking for a teammate. By default, teams do not advertise for new members.

## Team invitations

If a team invite you, you can accept or deny the invitation.

You are free to never accept or deny any invitation.

{% hint style="info" %}
An invitation cannot be canceled by a team.
{% endhint %}

## Editing your team

Team edition can be done by any member at anytime (only during the [Submission Phase](../../other/glossary.md#submission-phase)).

The fields are the same as for creating a new team.

### Looking for Teammates

If a team is looking for teammates, users who are looking for one can ask to join via the "Ask to join" button.

The team receives an [Accepting a user](referendums.md#accepting-a-user) referendum, which the members must accept.
