# Rewards

## Strict Rules

The team is rewarded based on the best reward of all its members' models, **divided equally** among the team members.

{% hint style="warning" %}
No exceptions will be made. If a member is unreachable or refuses his share, **it will be considered as lost and will not be rewarded**. Choose your teammates wisely.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
i.e., in a team of three, each member receives 1/3 of the total reward.
{% endhint %}

## Disqualification

If a team is suspected of cheating, CrunchDAO may decide to disqualify it.
