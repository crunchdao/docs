# Rewards

## Strict Rules

The team reward is equal to the sum of the rewards of all its members, **divided equally** between the team members.

{% hint style="warning" %}
No exceptions will be made. If a member is unreachable or refuses his share, **it will be considered as lost and will not be rewarded**. Choose your teammates wisely.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
e.g.:

&#x20;   For a team of 3 members.&#x20;

&#x20;   Each member will receive 1/3 of the total team reward.
{% endhint %}

## Disqualification

If a team is suspected of cheating, CrunchDAO may decide to disqualify it.
