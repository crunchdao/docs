# Teams

## Overview

Teams can be composed of one person, and up to 5 (some competition may allow more).

A team can be [created and managed](managing.md#creating-your-team) by a participant.

Any decision must be [voted on in a referendum](referendums.md).

Team can [invite someone to a team](referendums.md#inviting-a-user), the invitee must then accept the invitation.

If a team is looking for teammates, [anyone can ask to join](referendums.md#accepting-a-user).

## Participate

You cannot submit as a team directly, each member of a team can only participate individually and each member will have a ranking on the leaderboard.

[Rewards will be shared equally among all members.](rewards.md)
