# Teams

Teams can be composed of one person, and up to 5.

Being part of a team means sharing the rewards for all members equally.

{% hint style="warning" %}
No exceptions will be made. If a member is unreachable or refuses his share, **it will be considered as lost and will not be rewarded**. Choose your teammates wisely.
{% endhint %}

## Modifications

Modifications can only be done while in a [Submission Phase](../../other/glossary.md#submission-phase). That includes:

* [creating a new team](./#creating-your-team)
* [editing your team](./#editing-your-team)
* [creating a new referendum](referendums.md)
* [voting a referendum](referendums.md#voting)
* [accepting an invitation](./#team-invitations)

## Creating your team&#x20;

If you see a TEAMS tab in the navigation bar, that means that you can submit as a team.

* The team name must be unique. The format must be a slug: all lowercase, with letters, numbers, and hyphens.
* The team description is just an optional text that will be displayed on your team overview.
* Looking for teammates allows users to find teammates. Teams can also advertise that they are looking for a teammate. By default, teams do not advertise for new members.

## Team invitations

If a team invite you, you can accept or deny the invitation.

You are free to never accept or deny any invitation.

{% hint style="info" %}
An invitation cannot be canceled by a team.
{% endhint %}

## Editing your team

Team edition can be done by any member at anytime (only during the [Submission Phase](../../other/glossary.md#submission-phase)).

The fields are the same as for creating a new team.
