# Teams

## Overview

Teams can be composed of one person, and up to 5 (some competition may allow more).

A team can be [created and managed](managing.md#creating-your-team) by a participant.

Any decision must be [voted on in a referendum](referendums.md).

Team can [invite someone to a team](referendums.md#inviting-a-user), the invitee must then accept the invitation.

If a team is looking for teammates, [anyone can ask to join](referendums.md#accepting-a-user).

## Participate

You cannot submit as a team directly, each member of a team can only participate individually and [each member will have a ranking on the leaderboard\*](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

[Rewards will be shared equally among all members.](rewards.md)

## Leaders

Some competitions require a leader to represent the team on the leaderboard. By default, this is the user who created the team, [but it can be changed by a vote](referendums.md#promoting-a-leader).

All members can submit on the platform, but only the leader will be able to be ranked on the leaderboard and so, be eligible for rewards.

The leader can only be changed during the [Submission Phase](../../other/glossary.md#submission-phase), and cannot be changed after that, even if:

* The selected [run](../../other/glossary.md#run) is not valid for the [Out-of-Sample](../../other/glossary.md#out-of-sample-phase).
* Another member has a better score.
