# Competitions

The competitions are the real fuel of the Crunch Foundation.&#x20;

The data quality is top tier and clients offer big cash prize in order to crowdsource predictions.

There are for now different format of collaboration:

* Limited in time competitions: The client buy the models to the rewarded winners.
* Continuous competitions: last in time. The client pays to query the model through our API to receive the community's prediction each hour/day/week/months.
* Rallies: Limited in time. It allows clients to test a dataset and the performance of the community models before launching a Continuous Competition.
* Code Competitions: Participant must submit the code of their model in order for the customer to query inferences from the submission.
* Predictions Competitions: Participant submit a simple prediction not the model or the code of the model.
