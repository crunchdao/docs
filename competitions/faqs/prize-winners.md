# Prize Winners

## I just received a prize, what should I do?

Congratulations on the good ranking! ðŸŽ‰

To receive a prize, specify your wallet on your [account page](https://hub.crunchdao.com/account/settings). This wallet must be personal and able to receive [USDC](https://www.usdc.com/) on the Ethereum network. All transactions will happen onchain.&#x20;

You will receive an email with instructions for completing the KYC process, which is required for receiving the funds. This helps us combat people with multiple accounts who try to beat our system.

Once everyone has completed the KYC process, we will send a test transaction of 1 USDC. Then, we will notify you via email to ask if you received it. This email will also contain a waiver making you accept the risk that, once we send the full amount, we are no longer responsible.

### Self-custodial Wallets

We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for its simplicity.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you store the seed phrase in a safe place.

Take every precaution to ensure that you are the sole owner of the wallet.
{% endhint %}

Once you receive your prize, whether it's the test or the full amount, you'll need a small amount of ETH to transfer it somewhere else.

You can transfer it from your Exchange account, but there is an easier method. See below for details.

### Centralized Exchange Wallets

To withdraw funds faster into a fiat currency, use your exchange's "Receive USDC" wallet. This will ensure that the funds appear directly in your account without you having to buy ETH to cover the transfer fees.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make absolutely sure that you can convert the 1 UDSC test back to fiat.

Once we send the full amount, you are responsible for the tokens.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If your exchange asks you about the origin of the tokens, tell them the following:

* Company Name: Crunch Lab, Inc.
* Exchange Name: Bitstamp.

If they request more information, don't hesitate to [contact us](contact-us.md#help-with-the-crytocurrencies).
{% endhint %}

## Why cryptocurrencies?

To avoid the need for international transfers, all prizes are paid in cryptocurrencies.

There will be **no exception** to this rule, such as asking for a bank transfer or equivalent.

This ensures that transactions are traceable on the blockchain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Network fees are determined by the Ethereum network and are outside of our control.

We recommend keeping a small amount of ETH in your wallet so that you can transfer your prizes at any time.

## <mark style="color:red;">Be on alert for Scams!</mark>

To keep your assets safe, always verify the source of any communication that claims to represent us. Verify email addresses and social media profiles. Remember that we will never ask for your private keys or passwords.

There is a 100% chance that the following is a scam:

* If you need to complete any KYC procedures or validation for your wallet! <mark style="color:red;">**That is a scam!**</mark>
* If you need to have any minimal amount to receive our prize. <mark style="color:red;">**That is a scam!**</mark>
* If we promise an airdrop in private/direct messages. <mark style="color:red;">**That is a scam!**</mark>
