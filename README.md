# Getting Started

## Introduction

CrunchDAO is a research team leveraging the power of collective intelligence and Web3 to produce next-generation financial predictions.

As a participant, you will be asked to build machine-learning models on the DAO's dataset.

Members are remunerated in $CRUNCH according to the correlation of their predictions with the stock market over the following 90 days.

The CrunchDAO's customers are paying the DAO for its financial forecasts.

The data crunchers receive payments according to their position on the leaderboards.

## Main steps

1. Sign up at [https://tournament.crunchdao.com/](https://tournament.crunchdao.com).
2. Download the dataset on a **weekly** basis.
3. Build your model and submit your predictions every week.
4. Get your **monthly $CRUNCH reward** based on the [Global Leaderboard](https://tournament.crunchdao.com/global-leaderboard).
5. Don't forget to join the [working community on Discord!](https://discord.gg/veAtzsYn3M)
6. Engage in the governance of the DAO by joining our [voting platform](https://snapshot.org/#/datacrunch.eth)!
