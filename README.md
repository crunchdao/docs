# Welcome

## What is Crunch?

At its core, Crunch is a collective intelligence protocol that distributes machine learning workloads across a global community.

* 10,000+ ML engineers and 1,200+ PhDs contribute models.
* Participants span 100+ countries, each bringing unique perspectives and methods.
* The protocol structures this effort into Crunches, prediction challenges with clear rules, rewards, and evaluation criteria.

This system has already delivered results for world-class institutions:

* [ADIA Lab (research arm of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority)](https://www.adialab.ae/) – achieved double-digit improvements in financial forecasting.
* [Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) – outperformed internal benchmarks in cancer research using predictive genomics.

## Why Crunch?

Traditional predictive modeling is limited by silos. Large in-house teams face bottlenecks, while independent researchers lack resources and exposure. Crunch solves this by:

* **Lowering barriers**: Anyone with skill can compete, regardless of geography or institutional backing.
* **Unlocking diversity**: A network of independent approaches outperforms centralized teams stuck in single modes of thinking.
* **Ensuring security**: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) guarantee models remain private, verifiable, and fully owned by their creators.
* **Delivering results**: Aggregated predictions (ensembles, composites, mixtures of experts) are continuously tested, updated, and deployed in real-world environments.

With Crunch, you focus on building the best model. We handle infrastructure, evaluation, and reward distribution

## Who can Participate?

Everyone. Crunch is open and permissionless.

* **Machine Learning engineers**: Submit models, earn rewards, and prove your expertise.
* **Researchers and students**: Gain access to real-world data challenges and contribute fresh perspectives.
* **Institutions and coordinators**: Launch Crunches to harness global intelligence for finance, science, and beyond.

Python knowledge helps, but Quickstarter notebooks and community resources make onboarding fast and accessible.

## How it works?

1. [**Create an account**](https://hub.crunchdao.com/signup) – and explore active Crunches.
2. [**Join a Crunch**](https://hub.crunchdao.com/competitions) – each challenge has structured rules, data, and a prize pool.
3. **Build & submit models** – start with Quickstarters or bring your own innovation.
4. **Evaluation & rewards** – models are tested against live outcomes, ranked, and rewarded in USDC.
5. Scale & repeat – high-performing models can be aggregated into prediction feeds, securing long-term impact and recognition

## When Can You Crunch?

Crunches are always live. From financial markets to biomedical research, you’ll find competitions suited to your expertise and curiosity. New challenges are continuously published, offering opportunities to contribute, learn, and earn.

## The Future with Crunch

Crunch aims to be the bridge for humans and machines to collectively reduce uncertainty about the future.

By participating, you join a growing movement to:

* Democratize predictive intelligence.
* Align incentives between researchers, institutions, and innovators.
* Create a resilient, transparent, and global marketplace for models.
