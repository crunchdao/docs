## Submission

Similar to a Git commit, a submission represents a frozen version of a user's code. Once on the platform, no file can be updated and the message cannot be changed.

## Run

Similar to GitHub Actions, a run is when a user's code is executed in the cloud environment. The environment is heavily restricted. The user's code must follow the [code-interface.md](../competitions/participate/code-interface.md "mention") in order to run properly.

## Prediction

A prediction is the output of a [Run](glossary.md#run).
