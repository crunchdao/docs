# Competitions

## Why we use the Solana Blockchain?

Integrating blockchain technology enhances the CrunchDAO platform in several key ways:

* **Open Participation**: Third parties, beyond Crunch Lab, can post challenges, increasing the earning opportunities for Crunchers.
* **Privacy Guarantees**: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ensure that model code and data feeds remain private and secure.
* **Continuous Rewards**: Ongoing challenges pay out dynamically, enabling top-performing models to generate a steady revenue stream.

Solana is currently the best fit for CrunchDAO's real-time competitions and prediction feeds, offering fast transaction processing and low fees that fit perfectly with our requirements.

More importantly, Solana's vision—to be the leading platform for low-latency information transfer and financial software—closely aligns with CrunchDAO's goal of becoming the leading decentralized prediction network.
